## About Me

- 🐰 i'm a furry and a rabbit
- 💻 i'm an originally-self-taught-but-now-does-professional-stuff hobby developer
- 👀 i’m interested in making neat things, playing games, and being chill
- 🐍 python is my go-to language for most lil things that i need to automate quickly
- 🌱 i’m spent a little time practicing golang and typescript, and typescript was more related to my day-to-day, so i mainly focused on that for a while
- 💎 i'm also looking to learn ruby on rails, because it seems fun!
